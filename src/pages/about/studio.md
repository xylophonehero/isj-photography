## Welcome to my happy place!

>My studio brings all the babies to the yard <br>
>And they're like, "put my picture on a card."

I have a beautiful newly-renovated private home studio – this place is my pride and
joy! It’s a cosy, clean and warm place for mums and dad to sit back, totally relax in
my cosy corner, and enjoy a warm cup of tea or coffee whilst I make the magic
happen.

I truly believe that every stage in your children's lives should be celebrated and
captured. However, photographing newborn babies is something truly special. My
aim is to create beautiful, soft, and timeless images.

I use simple, natural tones and textures that best complement your baby. All
sessions are held in my warm, snug, natural-light home studio in Essex. My studio is
filled with simple, natural textures, wraps and minimalist props, which will all
available for use during your session.

I have lots of beautiful wall art displayed enabling me to help you find the perfect
pieces to be displayed in your homes.

I cannot wait to welcome you!
