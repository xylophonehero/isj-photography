## Hey

Welcome to ISJ Photography.

I’m Ieashia (with an i), the photographer behind the lens of ISJ Photography, based in Essex. My passion is capturing your precious moments when your family comes together and grows. 

I’m here for all your momentous moments. 

I’m a qualified and experienced photographer with my own cosy home studio. I have a BA (Hons) in Digital Photography from the London Southbank University and 10 years as a professional photographer under my belt. 

Let me tell your story and create visual heirlooms for you.
