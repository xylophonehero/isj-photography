      Ieashia did the photography for our wedding in June and all I can say is that our pictures came out amazing! So much attention to detail – they really were stunning. Everything was so natural and not staged, you didn't realise she was there half the time. Our package was very reasonably priced compared to some ridiculously overpriced quotes I was given. And the fact that the original photographer I had booked decided to cancel on me two months before, I feel that it was fate so that I could meet Ieashia. I would highly, highly recommend her.

      Ieashia was the perfect wedding photographer. She gets to know her clients as people and finds out who the important people at the occasion are as well as the bride and groom, so captures everyone on the special day. Ieashia made us feel very comfortable and relaxed, so we were ourselves in the beautiful photos she took. I used Krystev Kreates for my hair and makeup as well, and Ieashia and Zoran did a stellar job – I felt like a princess! My husband Nick and I would highly recommend Ieashia to anyone for any occasion.

      Ieashia did both the makeup and photography for my wedding day and I couldn’t have picked a better person. She made me feel amazing and captured our day perfectly, giving us photos we will cherish forever.
