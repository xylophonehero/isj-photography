      Ieashia did the photography for our wedding in June and all I can say is that our pictures came out amazing! So much attention to detail – they really were stunning. Everything was so natural and not staged, you didn't realise she was there half the time. Our package was very reasonably priced compared to some ridiculously overpriced quotes I was given. And the fact that the original photographer I had booked decided to cancel on me two months before, I feel that it was fate so that I could meet Ieashia. I would highly, highly recommend her.

      Ieashia was the perfect wedding photographer. She gets to know her clients as people and finds out who the important people at the occasion are as well as the bride and groom, so captures everyone on the special day. Ieashia made us feel very comfortable and relaxed, so we were ourselves in the beautiful photos she took. I used Krystev Kreates for my hair and makeup as well, and Ieashia and Zoran did a stellar job – I felt like a princess! My husband Nick and I would highly recommend Ieashia to anyone for any occasion.

      Ieashia did both the makeup and photography for my wedding day and I couldn’t have picked a better person. She made me feel amazing and captured our day perfectly, giving us photos we will cherish forever.

      When I used Ieashia to capture our firstborn photos, once again we were blown by the photos she took. I am so glad I chose Ieashia to capture the biggest moments of my life, as she tells a story with her photos and really makes the effort with everything she does. Thank you so much for everything you have done.

      I honestly couldn’t recommend Ieashia enough. Not only did she capture my husband and my wedding day, she also captured our firstborn child photos. As always, they came out absolutely stunning! If you’re looking for someone to do your wedding photos, I wouldn’t look any further. Ieashia is amazing! She captures the small things that you don’t see as you are busy and can’t be in more than one place at once! She also knows how you are feeling and what you are going through, so really looks after you. Her husband Zoran is amazing too, making sure my bridesmaids and husband were okay too. Everyone at the wedding couldn’t praise them enough – they are a lovely couple. I am so glad I chose Ieashia to capture the biggest moments of my life, as she tells a story with her photos and really makes the effort with everything she does. Thank you so much for everything you have done.

      Ieashia took newborn photos of my son when he was just four days old, and was great with him. She was so gentle and professional that he didn't wake up for the entire shoot, even though he was put into lots of lovely different poses. We now have some beautiful photos which were available to us promptly. Ieashia also responds to any question pre-and post-shoot very quickly. Thank you!

      Ieashia welcomed me into her studio, where she did my makeup and carried out a maternity photoshoot. She made me feel very at ease and did my makeup beautifully. The photos are stunning and I am very grateful for the effort Ieashia put into creating different backgrounds. She’s lovely to work with and is fab at what she does. Professional and friendly; she even made sure I was fed before I travelled back home xx

      I took my son Stanley to Ieashia for his first Christmas photoshoot and Ieashia was truly amazing! She was so good with Stanley, making him laugh and feel at ease to get the perfect photos. I’m so pleased with the outcome and can’t wait for Stanley’s future photoshoots! I can’t recommend her enough.

      Ieashia took photos for the wedding of my son Danny to his fiance Chelsea. The shots are beautiful! Ieashia also did a shoot with my grandchildren. That was perfect as well. She spent a long time with us all on the special day. This lady is worth her weight in gold!
