I could have never in my wildest imaginations envision that my first experience of becoming a mother, would be the same year that the world got turned upside down and faced a global pandemic. 


Everything we had hoped and dreamed stripped away from us. 
I have been mourning, even though I am blessed with life’s most perfect gift. I feel anger, I feel anxiety, and I feel lost. And I knew I couldn’t be the only one feeling this way. 


Being a photographer, telling a story through images is therapy to me. 

So I wanted to do what I know and do best to help other mums, by documenting them and telling their stories. 
This project has had to adapt and change since I first got running with it as we are back in another national lockdown but the way I am running with it now sums up our 2020 experience perfectly.



Every month another mum and their story will be featured, so do make sure to check back, like comment and share.
