  I have a beautiful newly-renovated home studio, where I’ll conduct your
  session. Your session will last about 2-4 hours.


  The most amazing thing – and what I love most about photography – is it has the power to transport you back to all those incredible moments.


  I love the feeling of creating an image that will bring back the emotions we experience at a particular moment in our lives. The images we create will become some of your most treasured possessions.


  I would love to create these images which will decorate your home with beautiful memories of you and your children.


  I create beautiful, soft and timeless images. Something that will go on to be treasured and passed on through the generations.


  As a mum, I have noticed how much time we spend behind the camera, hiding away not happy with how we look now. But our babies deserve to have us in these images with them, holding them tight, beaming ear to ear with love and pride.


  I want to help you create images that you can proudly hang in every room of the house, and even give as a gift to the grandparents.


  It’s time to create your legacy.

faqs:
  - question: How long will the session last?
    answer: |
      Around 2 hours
  - question: Where are you based?
    answer: >
      I do all my sessions from my beautiful cosy home studio in Chadwell Heath
      in Essex. I will give my address before you are due to arrive. I don’t
      travel for newborn sessions, however, if for some reason you are unable to
      get to me once your baby is born, please call me and we can arrange
      something.
  - question: When will my images be ready?
    answer: >
      Your images are hand-edited by me to the highest standard. This process
      takes around 10 days. Once your gallery is ready, you will be invited back
      to the studio for a private viewing session where you’ll choose your
      favourite images and what you’d like to purchase. Final payment is made on
      this day. 
  - question: Is the deposit included in the package?
    answer: |
      Yes. The £99 will be deducted from the balance of any package you choose.

Family is important.

To many people, family is everything.

So, it means a lot to have a nicely done family portrait done every now and then to
commemorate milestones or just to preserve lovely memories of how your family is right
now.

I’ll help your family relax, to capture the unique vibe that your family has with each other,
giving you a memory to cherish.
