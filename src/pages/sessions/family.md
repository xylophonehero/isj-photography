faqs:
  - question: How long will the session be?
    answer: |
      Around 2 hours
  - question: Where are you based?
    answer: |
      I do all my sessions from my beautiful cosy home studio in Chadwell Heath in Essex. I will give my address before you are due to arrive. I don’t travel for newborn sessions, however, if for some reason you are unable to get to me once your baby is born, please call me and we can arrange something.
  - question: When will my images be ready?
    answer: |
      Your images are hand-edited by me to the highest standard. This process takes around 10 days. Once your gallery is ready, you will be invited back to the studio for a private viewing session where you’ll choose your favourite images and what you’d like to purchase. Final payment is made on this day. 
  - question: Is the deposit included in the package?
    answer: |
      Yes. The £99 will be deducted from the balance of any package you choose.

now.
