  I run the hair and makeup company, Krstev Kreates, with my husband Zoran. I am
  a qualified, experienced makeup artist and Zoran is an accomplished
  hairdresser. 


  It makes your wedding day go even smoother (and saves you money) to have the same team do your photography and makeup. 


  If you’d like to book us for both, here are the price packages.

faqs:
  - question: Where are you based?
    answer: >
      For weddings, everywhere! I'm based in Essex, and I have photographed many
      local beautiful venues including Hedingham Castle, Gosfield Hall,
      Stockbrook Manor and Down Hall. I have photographed some amazing estate
      and manor houses in Kent and some classic and modern London Venues, for
      example Trinity House. I have travelled around the UK capturing weddings. 


      I am a travel bug with a real passion for travel after working and travelling the world on cruise ships and spending a year travelling Europe. So, if you’re planning a destination wedding (like I did), I would be more than happy to jump on a plane to tell your story! (Covid restrictions permitting). Contact me directly for a quotation. 
  - question: What is your style?
    answer: >
      Natural, candid, authentic and timeless. I want to capture and tell your
      story as it unfolds, giving a true representation of you and your day. I
      will capture the moments you won’t notice while you’re busy having fun and
      soaking up your day. I will also capture all the little details you spent
      months planning, so they won’t go unnoticed or get forgotten. Documentary
      style is a huge part of my work. A lot of my clients say that they forget
      I am there as I quietly move around, capturing every aspect of your day to
      retell a fabulous story. 
  - question: What can I expect from my images?
    answer: >
      Your images will be a true reflection of you and your day. The first time
      your bridesmaids see you in your dress. The nervous look of your groom as
      he is (im)patiently waiting for your arrival. The laughter, the tears, the
      looks of love. Best of all, the crazy dance moves once the party really
      gets started! I am not a photographer that will interrupt you to put you
      in awkward poses with your head looking left, whilst you balance on one
      leg, holding hands. 


      I want you to look back through your beautiful hand-crafted wedding album, and as you turn each page, all your memories of the day come flooding back.
  - question: What happens once we book you?
    answer: >
      First, you breathe a sigh of relief. You’re now in good hands! There’s a
      lot more to wedding photography than just taking beautiful photos on the
      day. 


      Second, we’ll arrange a pre-wedding consultation in person or by Zoom (covid restrictions dependant) so that we can discuss your wedding ideas and photography aims. That will give me more of an understanding of how your wedding day will go. You can trust me. I’ve been there. Before I had my own wedding, I had photographed lots of others and appreciated how much effort went into each day. But when planning mine, I really learned first-hand how stressful planning your day can be. So, I want to eliminate as much of that for you as possible.


      You can contact me as little or as much as you’d like. I usually become friends with most of my clients due to the amount of time we spend chatting. I can also help you with hair and makeup and recommend a videographer if you wish. You can rest assured that from the pre-wedding to the post-wedding process of selecting and editing photos and designing a beautiful wedding album, you have my full commitment.
  - question: Do you offer engagement/couples sessions?
    answer: >
      Yes, I do! I’d highly recommend booking one – especially if you are people
      who don’t really feel confident in front of the camera. These sessions are
      really informal and it’s a great way for us all to get to know each other
      more. You’ll see how I work and I can get a feel for your personalities
      and what your big day will be like. There is nothing worse than feeling
      awkward or not vibing with your photographer. 


      Ultimately, I am going to be spending the whole day with you and it’s your most important day. So, I want to be your friend. I want you to feel happy, safe and comfortable with me, because that’s when we get the best photos. This session can be at a location of your choice, at a place that’s special and important to you both, for example where you first met or got engaged.
