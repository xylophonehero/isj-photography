  Yes Mama!

  Do you realise how amazing you are right now? And what your body is doing?!

  Although you may be feeling terrible, sickness won’t budge, and none of your clothes fit – you are still beautiful. 

  I really don’t think we celebrate women enough for how incredibly strong and amazing we are for growing an actual human – albeit a tiny one – but still an actual human, who will make their stamp on the world and your heart, is growing inside you! 

  That is enough reason to celebrate and document this most special moment happening in your life right now. 

  Trust me when I say I didn’t feel that ‘pregnancy glow’ everyone talks about. 

  I really struggled adjusting to my new body, but when I look back on my maternity gallery, I am so in awe and so proud that I took these photos. I am glad my dear friend, and fellow wonderful photographer, took them of me. They are now hanging pride of place in my bedroom. 

  At your maternity session, I will take good care of you. I will feed you snacks, have caffeine-free drinks on tap for you, do your makeup, and you also can choose if you’d like to book for your hair to be done too. 

  Make the time for you mama. Be proud of yourself and what you are creating, so in a few months or years’ time you will look back on this time in your life and say “Wow, yes I did that!”

faqs:
  - question: When will we book my session?
    answer: |
      I advise booking maternity photos from the 20 week scan on.
      
      For sitter or older baby photos, you can book these at your newborn session or viewing or just contact me.
  - question: How long will the session last?
    answer: |
      Around 2 hours
  - question: Where are you based?
    answer: |
      I do all my sessions from my beautiful cosy home studio in Chadwell Heath in Essex. I will give my address before you are due to arrive. I don’t travel for newborn sessions, however, if for some reason you are unable to get to me once your baby is born, please call me and we can arrange something.
  - question: When will my images be ready?
    answer: |
      Your images are hand-edited by me to the highest standard. This process takes around 10 days. Once your gallery is ready, you will be invited back to the studio for a private viewing session where you’ll choose your favourite images and what you’d like to purchase. Final payment is made on this day. 
  - question: Is the deposit included in the package?
    answer: |
      Yes. The £99 will be deducted from the balance of any package you choose.
