  Whether you are planning a wedding in the UK or abroad, I'd love to chat!

  Every wedding is different, and every couple’s needs are different. 

  That’s why my packages are not set in stone. 

  I work together with my couples to get the package that is best for you, your needs – and your day. There is no wedding too big or too small. 

  There is so much to consider when picking the right photographer for you. 

  There is so much choice nowadays. There are so many different prices, and a lot of the time you don’t even know where to start! 

  If I can offer any advice, it would be fall in love with the work you see first. Your wedding photographs are the one thing that you will have left after the day has finished! 

  The cake gets eaten, the guests go home, the dress goes back in the box. The photographs are the one thing that really helps keep your memories of the day alive. The feelings rush back, and you get to relive the day over and over again every time you look through them. 

  I would absolutely love to tell your story, in a natural, candid, relaxed style. Capturing the raw real emotions and stories, giving you a visual heirloom to be proud of. 

  I am not just your wedding photographer  

  I am your friend. I’m there to make you laugh when you're feeling anxious. I’ll calm you down when you're stressed.

  I’m there when you're about to have that last minute freak-out.

  I am also your makeup artist. I will always have an emergency kit at the ready, and have lashes and glue for when the tears appear.

  I am there for you to help get you into your dress, to do up the zips, fix the ties, fasten the buckles, remind you you've got hair bands on your wrist, hold your bags, have the tissues ready, direct the guests, and can even transport your Auntie Joan to the reception.

  There is no ask too big or too small on your wedding day. If you want to see me, you'll see me. If you want me to blend in with the guests, I can certainly do that too. No two weddings are ever the same, and that is why I love my work so much!

  My style and approach to weddings is very relaxed, non-obtrusive and natural. I capture the moments as they unfold and tell your story through images.

  A wedding should be one of the most important, most memorable days of a couple’s life. As a couple you should be able to take in every single moment, and really enjoy the day you've spent so long planning.  As a photographer, I believe the moments should be captured and turned into memories. The raw emotions should be frozen in time, and the fun should be embraced – not forced, posed or set up. 

  I LOVE capturing weddings! It is literally the biggest honour to be a part of your day! I love how every single wedding and every single couple is different. I will work with and serve you, adapting to every environment. There is no wedding too big or too small. 
  Get in touch with me by email at <a href="mailto:isjphoto@hotmail.co.uk">isjphoto@hotmail.co.uk</a> if you like my style and would like to know more.  

  I look forward to hearing from you.

faqs:
  - question: Where are you based?
    answer: |
      For weddings, everywhere! I'm based in Essex, and I have photographed many local beautiful venues including Hedingham Castle, Gosfield Hall, Stockbrook Manor and Down Hall. I have photographed some amazing estate and manor houses in Kent and some classic and modern London Venues, for example Trinity House. I have travelled around the UK capturing weddings. 

      I am a travel bug with a real passion for travel after working and travelling the world on cruise ships and spending a year travelling Europe. So, if you’re planning a destination wedding (like I did), I would be more than happy to jump on a plane to tell your story! (Covid restrictions permitting). Contact me directly for a quotation. 
  - question: What is your style?
    answer: |
      Natural, candid, authentic and timeless. I want to capture and tell your story as it unfolds, giving a true representation of you and your day. I will capture the moments you won’t notice while you’re busy having fun and soaking up your day. I will also capture all the little details you spent months planning, so they won’t go unnoticed or get forgotten. Documentary style is a huge part of my work. A lot of my clients say that they forget I am there as I quietly move around, capturing every aspect of your day to retell a fabulous story. 
  - question: What can I expect from my images?
    answer: |
      Your images will be a true reflection of you and your day. The first time your bridesmaids see you in your dress. The nervous look of your groom as he is (im)patiently waiting for your arrival. The laughter, the tears, the looks of love. Best of all, the crazy dance moves once the party really gets started! I am not a photographer that will interrupt you to put you in awkward poses with your head looking left, whilst you balance on one leg, holding hands. 

      I want you to look back through your beautiful hand-crafted wedding album, and as you turn each page, all your memories of the day come flooding back.
  - question: What happens once we book you?
    answer: |
      First, you breathe a sigh of relief. You’re now in good hands! There’s a lot more to wedding photography than just taking beautiful photos on the day. 

      Second, we’ll arrange a pre-wedding consultation in person or by Zoom (covid restrictions dependant) so that we can discuss your wedding ideas and photography aims. That will give me more of an understanding of how your wedding day will go. You can trust me. I’ve been there. Before I had my own wedding, I had photographed lots of others and appreciated how much effort went into each day. But when planning mine, I really learned first-hand how stressful planning your day can be. So, I want to eliminate as much of that for you as possible.

      You can contact me as little or as much as you’d like. I usually become friends with most of my clients due to the amount of time we spend chatting. I can also help you with hair and makeup and recommend a videographer if you wish. You can rest assured that from the pre-wedding to the post-wedding process of selecting and editing photos and designing a beautiful wedding album, you have my full commitment.
  - question: Do you offer engagement/couples sessions?
    answer: |
      Yes, I do! I’d highly recommend booking one – especially if you are people who don’t really feel confident in front of the camera. These sessions are really informal and it’s a great way for us all to get to know each other more. You’ll see how I work and I can get a feel for your personalities and what your big day will be like. There is nothing worse than feeling awkward or not vibing with your photographer. 

      Ultimately, I am going to be spending the whole day with you and it’s your most important day. So, I want to be your friend. I want you to feel happy, safe and comfortable with me, because that’s when we get the best photos. This session can be at a location of your choice, at a place that’s special and important to you both, for example where you first met or got engaged.

You’ve found your “one”, you’ve made all the plans. Now it’s time to walk down that aisle
and say your vows in front of your loved ones.

This is the happiest day of your life.

So, you want to remember it.

Your big day is here, so just relax, and enjoy it and I’ll capture the precious moments of you
and your spouse, with your family and friends around you.
