  I have a beautiful newly-renovated home studio, where I’ll conduct your session. 

  These sessions are really informal and it’s a great way for us to get to know each other more. You’ll see how I work, and I’ll get a feel for your personalities and what your day will be like. There is nothing worse than feeling awkward or not vibing with your photographer. I’ll be spending the whole of your big day day with you and it’s your most important day. So, I want to be your friend. I want you to feel happy, safe and comfortable with me – that’s when we get the best photos!

  This session can be at a location of your choice. A place that’s special and important to you both, such as where you first met or got engaged.

  - question: Do you offer engagement/couples sessions?
    answer: |
      Yes, I do! I’d highly recommend booking one – especially if you are people who don’t really feel confident in front of the camera. These sessions are really informal and it’s a great way for us all to get to know each other more. You’ll see how I work and I can get a feel for your personalities and what your big day will be like. There is nothing worse than feeling awkward or not vibing with your photographer. 

      Ultimately, I am going to be spending the whole day with you and it’s your most important day. So, I want to be your friend. I want you to feel happy, safe and comfortable with me, because that’s when we get the best photos. This session can be at a location of your choice, at a place that’s special and important to you both, for example where you first met or got engaged.
  - question: Where are you based?
    answer: |
      I do all my sessions from my beautiful cosy home studio in Chadwell Heath in Essex. I will give my address before you are due to arrive. For family, maternity and engagement sessions these can also take place at a chosen local location or country park.
  - question: When will my images be ready?
    answer: |
      Your images are hand-edited by me to the highest standard. This process takes around 10 days. Once your gallery is ready, you will be invited back to the studio for a private viewing session where you’ll choose your favourite images and what you’d like to purchase. Final payment is made on this day. 
  - question: Is the deposit included in the package?
    answer: |
      Yes. The £99 will be deducted from the balance of any package you choose.

This is it! You’ve finally found your true love, your soulmate, your person, your “one”.
So, this is a moment in your life to remember.

While you’re unlikely to have a photographer on hand to photograph this moment as it
happened (although, that could potentially be arranged, depending on where the question
popping will happen), you can arrange for me to be there to capture the moment now.

Choose to wear your finery, or wear something comfortable that just represents how you
spend your time together.

I’ll help you commemorate this magical moment with photos that captures your happiness.
