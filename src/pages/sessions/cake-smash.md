  Celebrate your baby’s first birthday in style!

  Wow! How fast has the year gone by? Your baby’s first ever birthday – what a milestone!

  These shoots are an ideal way to document, capture and celebrate. What better way for a baby to celebrate, than diving headfirst into their own birthday cake! The fun is followed by a nice warm bubble bath and bubbles.

  You will have up to two hours studio time. All sessions include classic portraits, so bring mum, dad and the siblings along too!

  It’s best to book these sessions for when your baby is 11 months old. This way you can use the images for their first birthday as party invites, thank you cards,or have them printed and displayed at the main event!

  We will have a full consultation beforehand, where you will get all the essential information.

faqs:
  - question: When will we book my session?
    answer: >
      I feel the best time to photograph you newborn is when your baby is
      between 4-14 days old. I highly recommend you book your session as soon as
      you know your due date. We will make a provisional booking and patiently
      await their arrival. If it doesn’t work out for me to photograph your baby
      by 14 days old, we can do this when your baby is a little older, no
      problem. The session may take a little longer as after 14 days your baby
      is no longer at their sleepiest. They become more alert, and less curled
      and snuggled. Nevertheless, we will achieve beautiful images that you’ll
      love forever. Your baby may be more awake and not be able to be put into
      the same poses as babies 14 days old or younger. But there are many poses
      we can do to show off their perfect little selves.
  - question: How long will the session last?
    answer: >
      Around 2-4 hours depending on your baby. All sessions are baby led, so if
      they’re super sleepy, sessions will be on the shorter side but if they
      need extra feeding, burping or changing, then we will simply take more
      time. 


      I never rush you or your baby, so there is no need for you to stress if baby needs extra feeds (I am known for my patience, even though my husband may disagree!) Please don’t have anything planned for directly after your session though, as we can possibly go over time. 


      I provide all newborn props, outfits and backdrops, so all you will need to bring to your session are the baby’s feeds, with some extra to be on the safe side – and a backup outfit for mum and dad in case of any accidents. I’ll email you how to prep for your session before it, with more in-depth information of what to expect, what to wear, and my address. 
  - question: How long are sitter and cake smash sessions for older babies?
    answer: >
      Around two hours.


      For cake smash, book this while at your sitter session or at least six months before the birthday, to make sure i can fit you in.
  - question: Where are you based?
    answer: >
      I do all my sessions from my beautiful cosy home studio in Chadwell Heath
      in Essex. I will give my address before you are due to arrive. I don’t
      travel for newborn sessions, however, if for some reason you are unable to
      get to me once your baby is born, please call me and we can arrange
      something.
  - question: When will my images be ready?
    answer: >
      Your images are hand-edited by me to the highest standard. This process
      takes around 10 days. Once your gallery is ready, you will be invited back
      to the studio for a private viewing session where you’ll choose your
      favourite images and what you’d like to purchase. Final payment is made on
      this day. 
  - question: Is the deposit included in the package?
    answer: |
      Yes. The £99 will be deducted from the balance of any package you choose.

The tiny bundle of joy you’ve been waiting for has arrived.

This little person has become the centre of your world, and you can’t even say how much
love you have for them.

So, I’ll capture this love in photos.

Your baby won’t be this small for long, but the beautiful newborn photos I’ll take of them
will last forever.
